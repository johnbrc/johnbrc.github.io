Together these involvements have facilitated:\r\n\r\n- \tThe development of key business and leadership skills and experience;\r\n- \tThe defining of a vocational philosophy of Christian work;\r\n-\tThe financial underwriting of itinerant missionary engagement with Africa.\r\n\r\n## Vocational Foundations ##\r\n\r\n### Academic ###\r\n\r\nAn academic foundation for doctoral research was laid by completion, in 2008, of a Master of Philosophy degree in Intercultural Studies, incorporating this thesis: \r\n\r\n-\t[The Eternal Purpose of God—A Biblical Theology of Covenant, Creation and Community][thesis]\r\n\r\n### Spiritual ###\r\n\r\nMy missional vocation grew out of a sustained period of personal study, discipleship (mentoring) and intercessory prayer, as part of an intercultural team of people committed to praying for God's mission to the nations of the world. During that time the aspiration was born in me to write and publish educational, leadership resources that could equip under-resourced missional leaders within Africa.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, a missional perspective was seminally established during of a period of leadership training and discipleship with [DCI], following a profound conversion towards Jesus Christ, in 1987, whilst studying Civil Engineering at Nottingham University.\r\n\r\n[Maize Plant Discipleship]: http://maizeplantdiscipleship.wordpress.com\r\n[Website]: http://jbclements.wordpress.com/\r\n[DCI]: http://dci.org.uk/free-training\r\n[Linked-In]: http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jbclements/\r\n[@johnbrc]: http://johnbrc.github.io\r\n[thesis]: http://jbclements.wordpress.com/research/mphil/eternal-purpose-of-god-thesis/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
