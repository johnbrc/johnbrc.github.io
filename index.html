<p>My vocation is that of educator, incorporating writing and peripatetic teaching. </p>

<h3>
<a name="maize-plant-discipleship" class="anchor" href="#maize-plant-discipleship"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Maize Plant Discipleship</h3>

<p>I am currently engaged in the development of the following resource, which is designed to be appropriate to leaders and learners in Burkina Faso and other African and post-colonial contexts. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hereafter,%20MPD">Maize Plant Discipleship</a></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="doctoral-research" class="anchor" href="#doctoral-research"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Doctoral Research</h3>

<p>MPD was developed in parallel with doctoral research, undertaken in partnership with Fuller Theological Seminary, which lead to my dissertation:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Facilitating a Renewal of Discipleship Praxis Amongst Burkinabé Leaders and Learners <em>(publication forthcoming)</em>
</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="vocational-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#vocational-philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vocational Philosophy</h2>

<p>My intercultural work forms part of a broad vocation that has encompassed structural engineering, desktop publishing, printing, website development and property management. Together these involvements have facilitated:</p>

<ul>
<li>  The development of key business and leadership skills and experience;</li>
<li>  The defining of a vocational philosophy of Christian work;</li>
<li>  The financial underwriting of itinerant missionary engagement with Africa.</li>
</ul><h2>

<h3>
<a name="academic" class="anchor" href="#academic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic</h3>

<p>An academic foundation for doctoral research was laid by completion, in 2008, of a Master of Philosophy degree in Intercultural Studies, incorporating this thesis: </p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://jbclements.wordpress.com/research/mphil/eternal-purpose-of-god-thesis/">The Eternal Purpose of God—A Biblical Theology of Covenant, Creation and Community</a>
</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="spiritual" class="anchor" href="#spiritual"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spiritual</h3>

<p>My missional vocation grew out of a sustained period of personal study, discipleship (mentoring) and intercessory prayer, as part of an intercultural team of people committed to praying for God's mission to the nations of the world. During that time the aspiration was born in me to write and publish educational, leadership resources that could equip under-resourced missional leaders within Africa.</p>

<p>Prior to this, a missional perspective was seminally established during of a period of leadership training and discipleship with <a href="http://dci.org.uk/free-training">DCI</a>, following a profound conversion towards Jesus Christ, in 1987, whilst studying Civil Engineering at Nottingham University.</p>
