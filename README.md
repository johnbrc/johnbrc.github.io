## Dr JB Clements, Educator (Missiology and Discipleship)

My intercultural work forms part of a broad vocation that has encompassed structural engineering, desktop publishing, printing, website development and property management. These involvements have facilitated the development of business and leadership skills, a vocational philosophy of Christian work and service and the financial underwriting of both my itinerant missionary engagement in Burkina Faso and my doctoral research .
