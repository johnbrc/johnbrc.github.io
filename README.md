## Dr JB Clements, Educator (Missiology and Discipleship)

Over the past twenty-five years, my intercultural missionary work has formed part of a broad vocation encompassing structural engineering, desktop publishing, printing, website development, property management, teaching, training, mentoring, writing and publishing.

My experience has facilitated the development of a wide range of business and leadership skills, a holistic, vocational philosophy of Christian life, work and service and an itinerant, missionary engagement with Africa that has taken place without any institutional backing.

## Maize Plant Discipleship

I am currently engaged in developing a learning resource, named *Maize Plant Discipleship*, designed to be appropriate to leaders and learners in Burkina Faso and other African contexts, formulated in response with doctoral research carried out with Fuller School of Intercultural Studies.
