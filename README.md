Maize Plant Discipleship (MPD) is a learning resource designed to be appropriate to leaders and learners in Burkina Faso and other African and post-colonial contexts. MPD was developed in parallel with doctoral research, undertaken in partnership with Fuller Theological Seminary.

### Dr JB Clements, Educator (Missiology and Discipleship)

My intercultural work forms part of a broad vocation that has encompassed structural engineering, desktop publishing, printing, website development and property management. These involvements have facilitated the development of business and leadership skills, a vocational philosophy of Christian work and service and the financial underwriting of both my itinerant missionary engagement in Burkina Faso and my doctoral research .
