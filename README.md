## Dr JB Clements, Educator (Missiology and Discipleship)

Over the past twenty-five years, my intercultural missionary work has formed part of a broad vocation encompassing structural engineering, desktop publishing, printing, website development, property management, teaching, training, mentoring, writing and publishing.

My experience has facilitated the development of a wide range of business and leadership skills, a holistic, vocational philosophy of Christian life, work and service and an itinerant, missionary engagement with Africa that has taken place without any institutional backing.

I am currently engaged in developing a learning resource, named *Maize Plant Discipleship*, designed to be appropriate to leaders and learners in Burkina Faso and other African contexts, formulated in response with doctoral research carried out with Fuller School of Intercultural Studies.

Maize Plant Discipleship (MPD) is a learning resource designed to be appropriate to leaders and learners in Burkina Faso and other African and post-colonial contexts. MPD was developed in parallel with doctoral research, undertaken in partnership with Fuller Theological Seminary.
